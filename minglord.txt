training data:
  label = euchre, content = can the upcard ever be the left bower
  label = euchre, content = when would the dealer ever prefer a card to the upcard
  label = euchre, content = bob played the same card twice is he cheating
  label = euchre, content = how to remove a card from players hand
  label = euchre, content = anyone want to play some euchre
  label = calculator, content = how to assert rational invariants
  label = calculator, content = does stack need its own big three
  label = calculator, content = valgrind memory error not sure what it means

test data:
  correct = euchre, predicted = euchre, log-probability score = -13.7
  content = my code segfaults when bob is the dealer

  correct = euchre, predicted = calculator, log-probability score = -12.5
  content = no rational explanation for this bug

  correct = calculator, predicted = calculator, log-probability score = -13.6
  content = countif function in stack class not working

performance: 2 / 3 posts predicted correctly
